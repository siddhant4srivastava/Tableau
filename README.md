## Problem Statement

Roger Ferro, the Country Head of a multinational retail company, is tasked with boosting sales numbers and ensuring that the companyâ€™s inventory is optimized. His goal is to implement effective sales techniques to increase sales across various product categories and vendors. To achieve this, he needs to analyze sales data, inventory status, product prices, and quality ratings for different categories and subcategories.

The project involves creating dashboards that help Roger analyze sales trends, evaluate inventory performance, and ensure that sufficient stock is available to meet customer demands. This data-driven approach will help the company scale sales, manage inventory, and implement strategies to boost sales during low-profit periods.

## Reporting Scenario

Create interactive dashboards based on the "Sales Analysis" Excel sheet, which will enable the country head to:

- Analyze stock levels, price, and number of items sold across different categories and subcategories.
- Evaluate inventory status for various categories, subcategories, and individual items.
- Identify trends in sales and inventory performance over time.
- Ensure that there is enough stock to meet customer demands during various sales periods.

## Dashboard 1: Inventory Performance Dashboard

### Requirements:

- **Category and Year Performance**: Display data sorted from highest to lowest in terms of vendor item price, comparing the "End On Hand" and "On Order" units for the selected category and subcategory.
  
- **Monthly Inventory Comparison**: Show a month-by-month breakdown of "End On Hand" and "On Order" units for each year, allowing the user to select specific categories and subcategories.

- **Linkage Between Selections**: Ensure that the category and subcategory selections are linked, allowing for real-time updates in the dashboard as different filters are applied.

### Features:

- **Category Selection**: Drop-down list for selecting categories.
- **Subcategory Selection**: Drop-down list for selecting subcategories, dependent on the category choice.
- **Performance Graph**: A visual representation (e.g., bar chart, line chart) comparing "End On Hand" and "On Order" units across categories and subcategories.
- **Monthly Breakdown**: Display a line graph showing the trend of monthly "End On Hand" and "On Order" units over the years.

### Purpose:

This dashboard will help Roger Ferro evaluate the performance of different inventory items across multiple categories, highlighting which items are in high demand or low stock and identify trends that may affect inventory restocking decisions.

## Dashboard 2: Sales Trend Analysis Dashboard

### Requirements:

- **Sales Overview**: Show the total sales for each product category, subcategory, and vendor.
- **Profit Margin Comparison**: Display a comparison of the profit margins across categories to identify low-profit periods.
- **Sales Trends**: Provide a year-on-year analysis of sales performance for each category and subcategory.

### Features:

- **Sales Trend Graph**: Line or bar chart depicting sales trends over time.
- **Profit Margin Insights**: Pie chart or bar chart to compare the profit margins by category or vendor.
- **Top Performing Vendors**: A ranking of vendors by total sales and profit margins.
